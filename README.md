#Synesthesia - Regression


Regression analysis exploring what factors influence the likelihood of developing synesthesia.

##Project Overview 


This project investigates behavioral and demographic variables that may predict whether an individual experiences synesthesia. The goal is to build a regression model identifying which factors (e.g., age, gender, family history, imagery vivdness, musical training) most strongly correlate wih synesthetic traits.


##Objectives


-Identify key predictors of synesthesia from behavioral and demographic data 


-Apply statistical modeling to estimate likelihood 


-Visualize significant relationships and interpret model outcomes

##Data Source

This project will use a Synesthesia assessment dataset collected from a credible source. I've reached out to researchers who study Synesthesia to request access too anonymized data. If access isn't granted, I'll instead use a publicly available dataset to build and demonstrate the regression model framework.
